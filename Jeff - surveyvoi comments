Jeff - surveyvoi comments

Had to follow the following on mac to ensure up-to-date gfortran and then reinstall Rcpp, RcppArmadillo, RcppEigen:

Library issues with nlopt - added line dyn.load('/usr/local/lib/libnlopt.0.dylib') before dev.tools::load_all()

Successful knit with warning:

'Warning message:
The vignette title specified in \VignetteIndexEntry{} is different from the title in the YAML metadata. The former is "surveyvoi", and the latter is "surveyvoi: Survey Value of Information". If that is intentional, you may set options(rmarkdown.html_vignette.check_title = FALSE) to suppress this check.' 

output of line 76 - did you want it to display as r console output or as an sf table?

line 152- I think I was understanding this argument correctly?

line 169 - added a bit about xgboost being less data hungry than alternatives

lines 217-221 - General question about warnings - are they there for you, or do users sometimes modify these files?

line 302 - might want to ref your paper for example of Mahalanobis usage

made axis title capitalization consisent throughout

line 541- I'd say that we can understand how suboptimal they 'really' are in this plot too, just depends if you are looking relatively or absolutely. That said, it's unclear to me if 0.01 vs 0.013 is a big gain in an absolute sense for this example, so you may want to choose a starker example?
