## Installation

The _surveyvoi R_ package has several dependencies that must first be installed before you can install this package. Specifically, you will first need to install the [Gurobi optimization suite](http://www.gurobi.com/), [_gurobi R_ package](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/8.1/refman/r_api_overview.html), and Intel Math Kernel Library [(Intel MKL)](https://software.intel.com/en-us/mkl). For instructions on installing _Gurobi_ software, please refer to [this installation guide](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=prioritizr/vignettes/gurobi_installation.html). Please note that package is configured to assume that you have installed _Gurobi_ version 9.0.1. If you have a different version of _Gurobi_, please edit the `gurobi90` compilation flag specified in the `PKG_LIBS` variable within the `src/Makevars` file. For instructions on installing the Intel Math Kernel Library, please refer to the following bash commands (based on a [blog post by Dirk Eddelbuettel](http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2018/04/15/)):

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd /tmp
wget https://apt.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS-2019.PUB
sudo apt-key add GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS-2019.PUB
sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://apt.repos.intel.com/mkl all main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/intel-mkl.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install install intel-mkl-64bit-2020.0-088
```

You will then need to add the following commands to your `~./bashrc` file:

```
export MKLROOT="/opt/intel/mkl"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${MKLROOT}/lib/intel64_lin"
```

Finally, after installing the dependencies, you can install the package with the following _R_ commands.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
if (!require(remotes))
  install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("jeffreyhanson/surveyvoi")
```


## Usage

Just don't - it's still early in development and isn't ready yet.

## Citation

```{r, echo = FALSE, result = "asis", comment = ""}
