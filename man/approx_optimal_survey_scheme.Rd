\item{site_occupancy_columns}{\code{character} names of \code{numeric}
columns in the
argument to \code{site_data} that contain presence/absence data.
Each column should correspond to a different feature, and contain
binary presence/absence data (zeros or ones) indicating if the
feature was detected in a previous survey or not. If a site has not
been surveyed before, then missing (\code{NA}) values should be used.}

columns in the argument to \code{site_data} that contain modelled
probabilities of occupancy for each feature in each site.
Each column should correspond to a different feature, and contain
probability data (values between zero and one). No missing (\code{NA})
values are permitted in these columns.}

argument to  \code{site_data} that contain environmental information
for fitting updated occupancy models based on possible survey outcomes.
Each column should correspond to a different environmental variable,
and contain \code{numeric}, \code{factor}, or \code{character} data.
No missing (\code{NA}) values are permitted in these columns.}

one. No missing (\code{NA}) values are permitted in this column.}

\item{feature_model_sensitivity_column}{\code{character} name of the

probability of the initial models correctly predicting an absence of each
feature in a given site (i.e. the specificity of the models).
This column should have \code{numeric} values that are between zero and
one. No missing (\code{NA}) values are permitted in this column.
This should ideally be calculated using \code{\link{fit_occupancy_models}}.}

\item{survey_budget}{\code{numeric} maximum expenditure permitted
for conducting surveys.}

\item{xgb_parameters}{\code{list} of \code{list} objects
containing the parameters for fitting models for each
feature. See documentation for the \code{params} argument in
\code{\link[xgboost]{xgb.train}} for available parameters. Ideally,
these parameters would be determined using the
\code{\link{tune_occupancy_models}} function. Note that arguments must
have a \code{nrounds} element (see example below).}

\item{site_management_locked_in_column}{\code{character} name of the column
in the argument to \code{site_data} that contains \code{logical}
(\code{TRUE} / \code{FALSE}) values indicating which sites should
be locked in for (\code{TRUE}) being managed for conservation or
(\code{FALSE}) not. No missing (\code{NA}) values are permitted in this
column. This is useful if some sites have already been earmarked for
conservation, or if some sites are already being managed for conservation.

in the argument to \code{site_data} that contains \code{logical}
(\code{TRUE} / \code{FALSE}) values indicating which sites should
be locked out (\code{TRUE}) from being selected for future surveys or

low chance of containing the target species).
Defaults to \code{NULL} such that no sites are locked out.}

\item{prior_matrix}{\code{numeric} \code{matrix} containing
the prior probability of each feature occupying each site.
Rows correspond to features, and columns correspond to sites.
Defaults to \code{NULL} such that prior data is calculated automatically
using \code{\link{prior_probability_matrix}}.}

\item{n_approx_obj_fun_points}{\code{integer} number of points to use
for approximating the piecewise-linear components of the objective
function. Greater values result in more precise calculations, but
also incur more computational costs. Defaults to 1000.}

\item{optimality_gap}{\code{numeric} relative optimality gap for generating
conservation prioritizations. A value of zero indicates that
prioritizations must be solved to optimality. A value of 0.1 indicates
prioritizations must be within 10\% of optimality. Defaults to 0.}

\item{site_weight_columns}{\code{character} name of columns in
\code{site_data} containing weights for model fitting for each
feature. These columns must contain \code{numeric} values greater

equal weight when fitting models.}

\item{xgb_n_folds}{\code{integer} vector containing the number of
 k-fold cross-validation folds to use for fitting models and
 assessing model performance for each feature. Ideally, the number of folds
 should be exactly the same as the number used for tuning the
 model parameters (i.e. same parameter to the \code{n_folds}
 argument in \link{tune_occupancy_models} when generating parameters
for \code{xgb_parameters}).}

\item{n_approx_replicates}{\code{integer} number of replicates to use for
approximating the expected value calculations. Defaults to 100.}

\item{n_approx_states_per_replicate}{\code{integer} number of states to use
per replicate for approximating the expected value of a given management
action. This number must be smaller than or equal to the total number of
presence absence states in the system
(i.e. \code{n_states(nrow(site_data), nrow(feature_data))})
Defaults to 1000.}

used to sample states for approximating the expected value
calculations. Available options are:
\code{"uniform_with_replacement"}, \code{"uniform_without_replacement"},
\code{"weighted_with_replacement"}, \code{"weighted_without_replacement"}.
Uniform sampling methods have an equal chance of returning each
state, and weighted sampling methods are more likely to return
states with a higher prior probability of occurring.
Defaults to \code{"weighted_without_replacement"}.}

\item{seed}{\code{integer} state of the random number generator for
partitioning data into folds cross-validation and fitting \pkg{xgboost}
models. It is also used for generating states.
This parameter must remain the same to compare results from different
functions using the approximation methods. Defaults to 500.}

\item{n_threads}{\code{integer} number of threads to use for computation.}
}
\value{
\code{matrix} of \code{logical} (\code{TRUE}/ \code{FALSE})
values indicating if a site is selected in the scheme or not. Columns
correspond to sites, and rows correspond to different schemes. If
there is only one optimal survey scheme then the \code{matrix} will only
contain a single row.

This matrix also has a \code{numeric} \code{"ev"}
attribute that contains a matrix with the approximate expected values.
Within this attribute, each row corresponds to a different survey scheme
and each column corresponds to a different replicate.
}
\description{
Find the optimal survey scheme that maximizes return on investment using
value of information analyses. This function uses the approximation method
for calculating the expected value of the decision given a survey scheme.
}
\details{
The "approximately" optimal survey scheme is determined using a brute-force
algorithm.
Initially, all feasible (valid) survey schemes are identified given the
survey costs and the survey budget (using
\code{\link{feasible_survey_schemes}}. Next, the expected value of each and
every feasible survey scheme is approximated
(using \code{\link{approx_evdsi}}).
Finally, the greatest expected value is identified, and all survey schemes
that share this greatest expected value are returned. Due to the nature of
this algorithm, it can take a very long time to complete.
